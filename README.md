A very simple voting site using Koa

# Todo
* Export xls as a file - DONE
* Configuration moved to a file of it's own - DONE
* Write tests - DONE... Ah well... started at least
* Create a "Thanks for your response"-page with pobvssibility to add comment
* Create question-functionality, that:
** set up hospital
** set up tags
** set up question text
* Implement csv formatted export
* Filter the export on querystring parameters (?from=20120101&to=20120131&averagePer=day/week/month for example)
* Make pretty GUI-wise :P
